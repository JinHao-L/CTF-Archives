# Welcome to my CTFs archive
Date started: 15th August

## Introduction
To explorers that stumble across this repostiory:

I started this CTF archive to document the various CTF's challenges that I encountered and keep a record of my solutions/exploits to these challenges. 

This archives consists of the CTFs challenges scraped using [CTFdScraper](https://github.com/hanasuru/CTFdScraper)

## Write-ups
The purpose of this repository is not actually for my write-ups but rather for my personal CTF archives. As such, not every challenges will have a detailed writeup of my exploits but I'll try my best to do up a general approach for each challenge and maybe provide a link to well-written writeups.

If I have the time, I may start writing up a writeup blog. But thats prob for the future
